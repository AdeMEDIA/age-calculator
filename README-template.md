## My process

**HTML Structure**

I started by using a by creating a main element  with class "age-container" and then put another div inside named "container".

I placed the Card image inside the preview div.


I create another the footer for attribution to frontEnd mentor and to myself.

**CSS Styling**
I add the font-family to my css file by using the @facefont rule. 

I add a universal selector(*) to set margin and padding to 0.

Then use the body selector to add background-color and other styles to the body.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML tags
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
 
 This help me to understand CSS flexbox more.
 I'll be trying Grid layout soon ðŸ”œ.
